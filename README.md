# WeatherWall
Wallpaper that changes based on local area.

WeatherWall is a small project in Python 3.x to create a picture that updates throughout the day and updates one's wallpaper with the current weather and temperature. The height and position of the sun are based on the current time compared to the time of the local sunrise and sunset. All other objects in the scene have lighting based on the height of the sun. This program uses the Python image module, Pillow, to create, modify, and save the picture. This program uses the API at https://openweathermap.org/api to get the current temperature, weather, and sunrise/sunset times. Assets do not belong to me.
